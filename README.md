# Welcome to Online appendix of  Crème de la crème. Investigating Metadata and Survivability of Top Android Apps 

Mobile apps are distributed via online markets that allow developers to reach a large set of users in different geographic locations. With this online-market-based distribution model, developers have access to a high volume  of crowd-sourced requirements, comments, and ratings. In addition to crowd-sourced reviews, app markets contain valuable apps' metadata that have motivated a plethora of previous works  aimed at mining that information with different purposes. The online markets also operate as a board in which top apps are recognized in lists grouped by category and price, but also in curated lists as the editor choice list of Google Play. Despite the prolific amount of work on app store mining, to the best of our knowledge, the characteristics of the apps on those lists and other aspects such as the survivability in those top-notch lists have not been investigated. Thus in this paper we investigate metadata and survivability of apps in the tops lists of Google Play, from four different countries, and collected during 30 weeks.
