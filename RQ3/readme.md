## RQ3  _What are the top-list survivability patterns exhibited by the analyzed apps?_

You can find here the notebooks that were used for RQ3:
* Jupyter that was used for answering RQ3 for not imputed data (Main results) -> RQ3_not_imputed.ipynb
* Jupyter that was used for answering RQ3 for LOCF imputed data -> RQ3_LOCF_imputation.ipynb
* Jupyter that was used for answering RQ3 for MFO imputed data -> RQ3_MFO_imputation.ipynb

 In addition, an aux.py file can be found, it has useful auxiliar functions for RQ3 analysis. The notebooks use the .csv files that are generated by imputation notebooks
